TERA Arise is entirely community-funded and operates in a strictly non-profit
capacity. All funds are used for development and hosting only; we will never
offer paid services. Every financial transaction, both in and out, has a public
paper trial, and every payment made by the project goes through multiple stages
of verification and approval.

**We are currently not taking donations.**
