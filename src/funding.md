TERA Arise is entirely community-funded and operates in a strictly non-profit
capacity. All funds are used for development and hosting only; we will never
offer paid services. Every financial transaction, both in and out, has a public
paper trial, and every payment made by the project goes through multiple stages
of verification and approval.

If you would like to help keep the development of TERA Arise sustainable, please
consider donating through one of these channels:

* [![Open Collective](https://img.shields.io/opencollective/backers/tera-arise?color=mediumorchid&label=open%20collective)](https://opencollective.com/tera-arise)
* [![GitHub Sponsors](https://img.shields.io/github/sponsors/tera-arise?color=mediumorchid&label=github%20sponsors)](https://github.com/sponsors/tera-arise)

For any issues with your donation, please
