title: Introducing TERA Arise
summary: A game resurrection project for the final build of TERA EU.
---

TERA Arise is a game resurrection project for the final build of
[TERA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TERA_(video_game)) EU, 115.02 (r387486),
which was released a couple of months prior to the game's official shutdown on
June 30, 2022.

Unlike typical server emulation projects, TERA Arise is not trying to replicate
the original game. Rather, we are using the game client and assets as a base to
build upon, with the goal of eventually producing a better experience than the
original game. We will essentially start from scratch, with an empty data center
file, and work our way from there. Our overarching design goals are laid out on
our [GitBook space](https://tera-arise.gitbook.io/tera-arise).

Once the project progresses far enough, our goal is to run official TERA Arise
servers accessible to the public. That said, anyone is welcome to run their own
public servers using our open source software, as long as the
[licensing terms](https://opensource.org/license/agpl-v3) are observed.

The project is currently in heavy development; we expect a playable experience
to be a few years out still. If you would like to get involved in the design and
development process, feel free to drop by our
[GitHub organization](https://github.com/tera-arise) and
[Discord server](https://discord.gg/tera-arise).

If you would like to support our efforts financially, please visit us on
[Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/tera-arise) or
[GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/tera-arise). We operate in a
strictly non-profit capacity; all funds are used for development and hosting
only, and every financial transaction made by the project has a public paper
trail.
